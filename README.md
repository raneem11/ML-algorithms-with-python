# ML-algorithms-with-python

My implementation for machine-learning algorithms with python and using them to solve programming assignments from stanford university course in machine learning by Andrew Ng

# contents :

1- [Linear regression with one variable](https://github.com/raneem11/ML-with-python/blob/master/lin-reg-onevar.ipynb):

   - ex1 part 1 : In this part of this exercise, we will implement linear regression with one variable to predict profits for a food truck   using
    gradient descent algorithm 

2- [Comparing learning rates](https://github.com/raneem11/ML-with-python/blob/master/comp-learning-rates.ipynb)

   - in this part we will use gradient descent with housing prices data to compare different learning rates by visualizing cost function with number of iterations.

3- [Logistic regression](https://github.com/raneem11/ML-algorithms-with-python/blob/master/logistic-reg.ipynb)

   - in this part of the exercise, we will build a logistic regression model to predict whether a student gets admitted into a university using ex2data1.txt data file.
